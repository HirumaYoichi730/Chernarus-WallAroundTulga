DayZ Chernarus - Tulga.
I had this idea for Tulga after I had my base there.
So, as this is my first JSON file created I wanted to share this with all of you.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:
1: Land_Castle_Gate 2x
2: Land_Castle_Wall1_20 11x
3: Land_Castle_Wall1_20_Turn 10x
4: Land_Castle_Bergfrit 4x
5: Land_Castle_Stairs 4x
6: Bonfire 5x

So, one gate is leading to the main road and the other one is facing the woods for an easy
gathering of wooden logs and firewood.
Two towers are facing the main road and the other two are facing the woods.
The Bonfire on the towers are a an easy way to see the base from the distance.
And if you are down at the coast, you will be able to see the Bonfire from the road.
Making it easy to pinpoint where you are.
The Bonfire on the ground next to two houses is an easy way to get your clothes dry when it´s raining.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/WallAroundTulga.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/WallAroundTulga.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this base area.
